                <h2>What is the Pop Cultvre Monastery?</h2>
                Pop Cultvre Monastery is a one-stop-shop for all things Pop Culture throughout the years. Here you can travel through time, opening the archives of the years
                in order to take a glimpse of what music, movies, and trends were sweeping the nation that year. Furthermore, you can contact us if you'd like to see 
                trends added, be added to an email list for updates on the Monastery, or even window shop our merchandise line (coming soon)!<br><br>
                Pop Cultvre Monastery was mostly inspired by old Monasteries and Abbeys in which scholars passed down history, science, math, culture, and language over the span
                of many centuries. This website is analogous to that, although much less important; instead, it offers a quick glimpse of music, culture, and more. We hope you enjoy!

                Jabez Nuetey is a Junior at Missouri State University. He is majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cybersecurity. Jabez is an international student
                from Ghana, West Africa. Being a foreigner in the United States, the feeling of being left out in conversations about American Pop Culture always
                had a toll on Jabez. The thought of having a "one stop shop" for information about American Pop Culture is one that crossed Jabez's mind every time.
                 After garnering skills in web development, Jabez teamed up with Caleb Alexander—who shared his vision for a Pop Culture website—
                and they created the "Pop Cultvre Monastery". Aside creating websites, Jabez likes to listen to music and playing video games.

                Caleb Alexander is an upcoming senior at Missouri State University. He studies Computer Science and Mathematics, while also enjoying other hobbies such as
                playing the saxophone, playing board games, hanging out with friends, and listening to music. The original idea for the "Pop Cultvre Monastery" was inspired
                by Caleb's international travels, most notably when visiting The Abbey of Monte Oliveto Maggiore in Tuscany, Italy, where over 600 years of work was done
                by Monks to carry on science, history, culture, and more throughout the centuries. Caleb hopes to have a career in Computer Science while also maintaining
                avenues for artistic development.
